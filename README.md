# Level-Editor
A level editor I made using python and pygame with pixel art ui

Simply put all the files in the same directory, and run it using python 2.

Please note:
This was one of my first larger python-pygame projects and I was very new(I recommend against trying it out)
One file dialog at the start(and laziness) is the only reason it doesn't work in python3(easy fix)

After making this I made an improved version that was object orientated, although I never finished it.
The UI is heavily inspired by the ui in Aseprite, and uses a colour palette I found on a website called lospec.
